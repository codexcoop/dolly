      types: |
        Definition:
        The nature or genre of the resource. Type includes terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation levels for content.

Either a coded value or text string can be represented here. Use this element for the languages associated with the digital object. If the content is in more than one language, the element may be repeated. For example, the various languages spoken on video or in sound files. Use for text included in images (i.e. posters, newspapers etc). If there is no language aspect to the digital object (e.g. a photograph), please ignore this element.\r\n\
        Europeana note:\r\n\
        Use of RFC 4646 is highly recommended. This element is not for the language of the metadata of a resource, which should be described in xml:lang attribute. For example, <dc:title xml:lang=\xE2\x80\x9Den\xE2\x80\x9D>After dark</dc:title>. See <europeana:language>."

      type: |-
        Definition:
        The general type of the resource. 
        Europeana note:
        This element is used for the four general types supported by Europeana: TEXT, IMAGE, SOUND and VIDEO. This information is used in Europeana interface and in searches. Search results are categorized by the four types to helps users to find what they are looking for. An icon for the general type of object is displayed with each search result. A default thumbnail for the general type of object is used in the short or full record display when a thumbnail is not otherwise available (see <europeana:object>). Content providers are requested to create a mapping from the local type terminology used in their metadata to the four types used in Europeana. The mapping is typically based on the values in <dc:type>.
      is_shown_by: "Definition:\r\n\
        An unambiguous URL reference to the digital object on the content provider\xE2\x80\x99s web site in the best available resolution/quality. Refinement of <dc:relation>. See also <europeana:isShownAt>.\r\n\

        Europeana note:\r\n\
        For the Europeana prototype, <europeana:language> is the official language of the country where a content provider is located. It is derived automatically from the Europeana content providers\xE2\x80\x99 authority file. Content providers do not need to provide this information in their metadata. It is expressed using the ISO 639-1 (the two-character code) (e.g. \xE2\x80\x9Cen\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9Cde\xE2\x80\x9D etc).

        Europeana note:\r\n\
        For internal use only. See also <europeana:hasObject>. Thumbnail images are generated for display in Europeana from digital objects whose format (such as PDF, JPEG, and TIFF) is compliant with the Image Magik software which is used (http://www.imagemagick.org/). Image Magik needs to have direct access to the image to create a thumbnail; for example it cannot make a thumbnail out of an image embedded in an HTML page. Where no thumbnail is available, a default thumbnail for the type of object will be displayed. Europeana creates one thumbnail per record. If a record contains several pages in a PDF, the front page is used to create the thumbnail. If a record contains several image files, the first file that appears is used for the thumbnail."

    right: 
      rights_basis: ""
      statute_information_determination_date: The date that the determination was made that the statute authorized the permission(s) noted. The permission in question may be the subject of some interpretation. These assessments are made within a specific context and at a specific time. At another time the context, and therefore the assessment, could change. For this reason it can be important to record the date of the decision.
      linking_object_identifiers: The identifier on an object associated with the rights statement. Rights statements must be associated with the objects to which they pertain, either by linking from the rights statement to the object(s) or by linking from the object(s) to the rights statement. This provides the mechanism for the link from the rights statement to an object.  linkingObjectIdentifier is optional because in some cases it will be more practical to link from the object(s) to the rights statement; for example, a repository may have a single rights statement covering thousands of public domain objects.
      copyright_status: Information about the copyright status of the object(s).
      statute_note: "Additional information about the statute. Example: Applicability to web-published content sent for review by general counsel 9/19/2008."
      restriction: "A condition or limitation on the act. Examples: No more than three Allowed only after one year of archival retention has elapsed Rightsholder must be notified after completion of act"
      license_term: 
      term_of_grant_end_date: The time period for the permissions granted (end)
      copyright_note: "Examples: Copyright expiration expected in 2010 unless renewed. Copyright statement is embedded in file header."
      statute_jurisdiction: The country or other political body enacting the statute. The connection between the object and the rights granted is based on jurisdiction. Data constraint Values should be taken from a controlled vocabulary.
      rights_statement_identifier: to be system generated no global scheme or standard for these identifiers not repeatable unique within the repository
      term_of_grant_start_date: The time period for the permissions granted (beginning)
      act: The action the preservation repository is allowed to take. It is up to the preservation repository to decide how granular the controlled vocabulary should be. It may be useful to employ the same controlled values that the repository uses for eventType.
      copyright_jurisdiction: ""
      linking_agent_identifiers: Identification of one or more agents associated with the rights statement. Rights statements may be associated with related agents, either by linking from the rights statement to the agent(s) or by linking from the agents(s) to the rights statement. This provides the mechanism for the link from the rights statement to the agent.  linkingAgentIdentifier is optional because a relevant agent may be unknown, or in no agent may be relevant. The latter is likely when the rights basis is statute.
      license_identifier: This semantic unit is intended to refer to a document recording the granting of permission. For some repositories this may be a formal signed contract with a customer. If the granting agreement is verbal, this could point to a memo by the repository documenting the verbal agreement.  The identifier is optional because the agreement may not be stored in a repository with an identifier. In the case of a verbal agreement, for example, the entire agreement may be included or described in the licenseTerms.
      statute_citation: "An identifying designation for the statute. Examples: Legal Deposit (Jersey) Law 200- National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna M\xC4\x81tauranga o Aotearoa) Act 2003 no 19 part 4 s 34"
      copyright_status_determination_date: The date that the copyright status recorded in copyrightStatus was determined.
      license_note: Information about the terms of the license should go in licenseTerms. licenseNotes is intended for other types of information related to the license, such as contact persons, action dates, or interpretations. The note may also indicate the location of the license, for example, if it is available online or embedded in the object itself.
      linking_agent_role: The role of the agent in relation to the rights statement.
      rights_granted_note: This semantic unit may include a statement about risk assessment, for example, when a repository is not certain about what permissions have been granted.
